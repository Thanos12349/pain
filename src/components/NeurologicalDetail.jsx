Through specialized physiotherapy, patients work to regain strength, relearn motor skills, and improve speech and functional independence. Regular guided exercises, gait training, and neuro-muscular re-education help the brain form new connections, promoting long-term recovery and better quality of life.",

Treatment emphasizes exercises that improve balance, posture, and walking patterns while enhancing coordination and flexibility. With consistent therapy, patients can maintain independence, reduce the risk of falls, and experience improved mobility and confidence in daily activities.",

    title: "Multiple Sclerosis (MS)",
    desc: "In multiple sclerosis, the bodyâ€™s nervous system is affected, leading to weakness, fatigue, and coordination issues. Physiotherapy helps manage these symptoms through strength training, balance exercises, and energy-conservation techniques. The goal is to preserve physical function, minimize fatigue, and enhance overall mobility, allowing patients to stay active and self-reliant.",

Through targeted exercises, stretching, and gait training, muscle tone is regulated and movement patterns are refined. Early and consistent rehabilitation encourages better posture, balance, and coordination, helping children and adults achieve their fullest physical potential.",

Physiotherapists assist patients in strengthening unaffected muscles, improving mobility through assistive devices, and preventing complications such as contractures or pressure sores. The therapy encourages adaptation, promotes neural recovery, and enhances quality of life despite physical limitations.",
