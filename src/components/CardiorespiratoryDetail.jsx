Physiotherapy at home focuses on improving heart and lung efficiency, functional movement, and overall well-being.\n\nWe offer Cardiac Rehabilitation for post-surgery or post-cardiac event patients to safely rebuild endurance through guided exercise and breathing training. Respiratory and Post-COVID Therapy strengthens lung function, reduces fatigue, and enhances breathing capacity for patients recovering from respiratory illnesses like COPD, asthma, or long COVID.\n\nAlongside medical recovery, our team provides Functional and Lifestyle Supportâ€”including ergonomic correction, postural alignment, and fall-prevention trainingâ€”to ensure comfort and safety in everyday life. Personalized programs such as Functional Independence Training help patients regain confidence in daily tasks, while Massage and Myofascial Release Therapy relieves muscular tightness and promotes relaxation.\n\nThis holistic approach blends physical recovery with lifestyle enhancement, empowering patients to move, breathe, and live better right in the comfort of their home.",
