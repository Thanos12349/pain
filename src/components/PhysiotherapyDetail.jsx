Through personalized physiotherapy protocols, pain is managed, mobility is gradually restored, and complications like stiffness or muscle weakness are prevented. The goal is to ensure safe and effective recovery, helping patients return to their daily activities with improved function and independence.",

    desc: "Fracture rehabilitation plays a crucial role once the bone has healed sufficiently. Physiotherapy helps restore muscle strength, joint movement, and coordination in the affected limbâ€”whether itâ€™s an upper or lower limb fracture. Guided exercises and modalities reduce stiffness, swelling, and pain, promoting complete functional recovery and preventing long-term deformities or weakness.",

    title: "Sports Injuries",
    desc: "Sports injury rehabilitation focuses on managing and preventing injuries such as ligament tears, sprains, and muscle strains. The therapy involves pain control, strengthening, and sport-specific training to help athletes safely return to play. Physiotherapists also emphasize proper biomechanics, flexibility, and conditioning to reduce the risk of re-injury and enhance athletic performance.",

    title: "Arthritis Management",

Gentle strengthening and range-of-motion exercises, combined with pain-relief modalities, help reduce stiffness and maintain functional independence. Education on joint protection and posture correction also supports long-term joint health and comfort.",

The treatment plan includes manual therapy, stretching, core strengthening, and ergonomic guidance to reduce pain and prevent recurrence. By improving spinal alignment and muscle balance, patients experience better posture, reduced strain, and long-lasting relief.",

Physiotherapy uses targeted mobilization techniques, stretching, and strengthening exercises to restore flexibility and range of motion. Regular sessions not only ease discomfort but also enhance coordination, allowing smoother and pain-free movement in daily activities.",

Physiotherapists guide patients in maintaining optimal alignment during daily activities, supported by ergonomic training for home and workplace setups. This approach reduces strain on muscles and joints, promotes spinal health, and enhances overall physical well-being.",
