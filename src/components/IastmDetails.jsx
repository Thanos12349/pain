It helps improve blood flow, reduce pain, and restore normal movement patterns. This therapy is highly effective for chronic muscle stiffness, tendon injuries, and post-surgical recovery.",

It helps in reducing inflammation, easing pain, and improving tissue recovery in conditions like back pain, shoulder stiffness, and sports injuries. The technique also enhances relaxation and detoxification of soft tissues.",

It enhances blood flow, improves posture, and provides gentle stability without restricting motion. Commonly used by athletes and during rehabilitation, it promotes faster recovery and muscle activation.",

It uses specific movement patterns and manual resistance to improve joint mobility and muscle performance. PNF is especially beneficial in neurological and orthopedic rehabilitation for restoring smooth, functional movement.",
